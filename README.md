# CHT Product Roadmap
In this repository, you can find the [Community Health Toolkit product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/medic/projects/1120). The product roadmap serves as a plan for how the Community Health Toolkit will grow to realize our vision; it is where you can learn about what product initiatives we are working on and what stage they are in. Please note, the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.

## Guide to the Roadmap

### What is a Product Initiative?
Product initiatives are specific areas to improve the CHT that align with its medium and long-term vision. Initiatives are often worked on over multiple releases. When an initiative is scheduled, the team will start (or in many cases, continue) speaking with people who use the CHT to hear how the use it and where we can make the most impactful changes. As changes become ready, we will work out if a new CHT release is needed or if changes can go into an already-planned release in the near future.

### Roadmap Stages
Initiatives are arranged on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/medic/projects/112) with the following stages to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon:

| Stage | Description | Activities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Now** | Initiatives currently being worked on | Design, development, and release of related features and improvements |
| **Next** | Initiatives we'll likely be pursuing next | Scope out features and improvements with partners| 
| **Later** | Initiatives we may take on later | Early exploration of high level requirements, as well as partners and funding opportunities | 

### Roadmap Communication
Updated initiatives are communicated quarterly to the CHT Community on the [CHT Forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/c/product/roadmaps/25) and discussed on the CHT Roundup calls. Where possible, we will link to specific issues and/or documentation to elaborate on what was completed to move an initiative forward.
