# CHT Roadmap
In this repository, you can find the [Community Health Toolkit roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/medic/projects/112). This roadmap serves as a high-level plan for how the CHT will grow to realize the shared community vision; it is where you can learn about what initiatives the community is working on and what stage they are in. 

## Guide to the Roadmap

### What is a Community Initiative?
Community initiatives are specific areas to improve the CHT that align with the community vision set out by the community. Initiatives are often worked on over multiple releases. When an initiative gathers interest within the community, contributing organizations and community members form a squad and start working on the feature to be built. There are various stages within the development phase including design, building, testing and release, among others. Community members and organizations are encouraged to periodically review the [squad dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/medic/projects/112/views/24) and join squads at any stage.

### Roadmap Stages
Initiatives are arranged on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/medic/projects/112) with the following stages to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon:

| Stage | Description | Activities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Emerging** | Initiatives are currently under initial discussions | Exploration discussions, analysis of emerging requirements, and feedback collection/scope out features and improvements with partners. The outcome of these activities is a feature to be built by the community |
| **Active** | Partners and interested community members form a squad and actively begin building the defined feature | Squad formation, building & testing| 
| **Winding Down** | The built feature is ready for release | Releasing new feature to production, addition of feature to CHT releases and retrospectives  | 

### Roadmap Communication
Updated initiatives are communicated on the [CHT Forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/c/product/roadmaps/25) and discussed on the CHT Roundup calls. Where possible, we will link to specific issues and/or documentation to elaborate on what was completed to move an initiative forward.
