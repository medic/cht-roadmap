# product-initiatives
Repo for product owners and management team to organize product initiatives

Product initiatives are bodies of work to improve the Core Framework and associated tools. Initiatives are added to the appropriate product backlog to help organize and communicate information to stakeholders. 

An initiative can emanate from existing Github issues (ie to pull them together and contextualize) or from identified product opportunities without Github issues (ie to explore an area that could generate new product requirements). In either scenario, they will contain collections of user stories that help to align the team around a shared understanding of the requirements for individual personas. Issues that spawn from product initiatives are scheduled to one or multiple release cycles.
